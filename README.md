## Summary

This research project proposes an empirical strategy to estimate the **causal effects of financial aid** on children's long-term outcomes, including education, health, and social behaviour in Singapore. The design draws from established international literature and adapts it to the Singaporean welfare system—focusing on identifying treatment effects using:
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
- **Event Study regressions**
- **Instrumental Variables (IV) regression**

---

## Motivation

Singapore has over 80 social assistance schemes for low-income households. While well-targeted, little research exists on **long-term impacts** of these schemes on **children’s future mobility**, particularly in education and behavioural outcomes.

Our study fills this gap and is helpful for **policy evaluation**, identifying which types of aid are most effective.

## Research Methodology

- **Outcome Variables:**  
  - Academic results (e.g., L1R5, school attendance)  
  - Health status and clinic visits  
  - Behavioural indicators (e.g., absenteeism, disciplinary issues)

- **Treatment Variable:**  
  - Total per capita financial aid received by the child’s household

- **Controls:**  
  - Family income, parental education, demographics, household structure

- **Instrument:**  
  - Proximity to Social Service Offices (SSOs), as a proxy for likelihood of receiving aid

- **Empirical Strategy:**  
  - DiD and Event Study with IV to handle endogeneity and establish causality

---

## Assumption Checks

- **Common Trend Assumption** validated using pre-treatment trends  
- **Exclusion Restriction** for IV theoretically supported by SSO placement logic  
- **Falsification Tests** proposed with high-income household comparison  
- **Event Study coefficients (pre-k)** used to test for pre-treatment balance
